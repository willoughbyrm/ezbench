= EzBench =

This repo contains a collection of tools to benchmark graphics-related
patch-series.

== Installation ==

WIP

== Runner.sh / Core.sh ==

WARNING: This tool can be used directly from the CLI but it is recommenced that
you use ezbench in conjunction with ezbenchd which together support testing
kernels and which can recover upon errors.

WARNING 2: core.sh is now considered deprecated

This tool is responsible for collecting the data and generating logs that will
be used by another tool to generate a visual report.

To operate, this script requires a git repo, the ability to compile and deploy
a commit and then benchmarks to be run. To simplify the usage, a profile should
be written for each repo you want to test that will allow ezbench to check the
current version that is deployed, to compile and install a new version and set
some default parameters to avoid typing very-long command lines every time a
set of benchmarks needs to be run.

By default, the logs will be outputed in logs/<date of the run>/ and are stored
mostly as csv files. The main report is found under the name results and needs
to read with "less -r" to get the colours out! The list of commits tested is
found under the name commit_list. A comprehensive documentation of the file
structure will be written really soon.

You may specify whatever name you want by adding -N <name> to the command line.
This is very useful when testing kernel-related stuff as we need to reboot on
a new kernel to test a new commit.


=== Dependencies ===

The real core of ezbench requires:
 - A recent-enough version of bash
 - awk
 - all the other typical binutils binaries

If you plan on recompiling drivers (such as mesa or the kernel), you will need:
 - autotools
 - gcc/clang
 - git
 - make

To run the xserver, you will need the following applications:
 - chvt
 - sudo (set up not to ask for passwords in /etc/sudoers)
 - Xorg
 - xrandr
 - xset

To get visual feedback when compiling, you will need:
 - twm
 - xterm

If you want to use specify which compositor should be run, you will need to
install the following applications:
 - unbuffer (part of expect package)
 - wmctrl


=== Configuration ===

The tests configuration file is named user_parameters.sh. A sample file called
user_parameters.sh.sample comes with the repo and is a good basis for your first
configuration file.

You will need to adjust this file to give the location of the base directory of
all the benchmark folders and repositories for the provided profiles.

Another important note about core.sh is that it is highly modular and
hook-based. Have a look at profiles.d/$profile/conf.d/README for the
documentation about the different hooks.

It is possible to adjust the execution environment of the benchmarks by asking
core.sh to execute one or multiple scripts before running anything else. This
for example allows users to specify which compositor should be used.

If core.sh is currently running and you want to stop its execution after the next
test, you can create a file named 'requestExit' in the log folder.


=== Core.sh examples ===

You can use following steps to validate that ezbench is correctly
configured and working; it finds tests, it can run them, it can build
the software stack and it can do bisection.

WARNING: running core.sh directly is deprecated. You can skip to
ezbench section.


==== Listing tests ====

This lists all supported tests and their configurations:
    ./core.sh -l | tr ' ' '\n'


==== Running tests ====

This runs a single test without building anything:
    WIP


==== Testing every patchset of a series ====

The following command will test all the GLB27:Egypt cases but the ones
containing the word cpu in them. It will run all the benchmarks 5 times on
the 10 commits before HEAD~~.

    ./core.sh -p ~/repos/mesa -B cpu -b GLB27:Egypt -r 5 -n 10 -H HEAD~~

The following command run the synmark:Gl21Batch2 benchmark (note the $ at the
end that indicates that we do not want the :cpu variant). It will run all the
benchmarks 3 times on 3 commits (in this order), HEAD~5 HEAD~2 HEAD~10.

    ./core.sh -p ~/repos/mesa -b synmark:Gl21Batch2$ -r 3 HEAD~5 HEAD~2 HEAD~10

To use the mesa profile, which has the advantage of checking that the deployment
was successful, you may achieve the same result by running:

    ./core.sh -P mesa -b synmark:Gl21Batch2$ -r 3 HEAD~5 HEAD~2 HEAD~10

You may also tell core.sh that you want to use a certain compositor, set
environnement variables for the run or set any other option exposed by the
profile you are using. To do so, use -c like in the following example:

    ./core.sh -P mesa -b synmark:Gl21Batch2$ -r 3 -c confs.d/x11_comp/kwin HEAD


==== Retrospectives ====

Here is an example of how to generate a retrospective. The interesting part is
the call to utils/get_commit_list.py which generates a list of commits

    ./core.sh -p ~/repos/mesa -B cpu -b GLB27:Egypt:offscreen \
                 -b GLB27:Trex:offscreen -b GLB30:Manhattan:offscreen \
                 -b GLB30:Trex:offscreen -b unigine:heaven:1080p:fullscreen \
                 -b unigine:valley:1080p:fullscreen -r 3 \
                 -m "./recompile-release.sh" \
                 `utils/get_commit_list.py -p ~/repos/mesa -s 2014-12-01 -i "1 week"`


==== Giving a large list of tests to core.sh ====

The command line argument's maximum length is limited. If you ever feel the need
to pass a long list of tests in a reliable way, you may use the character '-' as
a test name. This will make core.sh read the list of tests from stdin, until EOF.
Here is an example:

    ./core ./core.sh -P mesa -b - -r 1 HEAD
    test1
    ...
    test5000
    EOF (Ctrl + D)


== ezbench ==

This tool is meant to make the usage of core.sh easy and support testing
performance across reboots.

It allows creating a new performance report, scheduling benchmark
runs, changing the execution rounds on the fly and then start, pause or halt
the execution of this report.

This tool uses core.sh as a backend for checking that the commits SHA1 and tests
do exist so you are sure that the work can be executed when the time comes.


=== Dependencies ===

Python3 modules:
 - dateutil
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - pygit2


=== Examples ===

==== Listing available tests ====

The ezbench program allows you to list the available tests by running:

    ./ezbench -l


==== Creating a report ====

The ezbench command allows you to create a new performance report. To create
a performance report named 'mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks', using the core.sh
profile 'mesa', you need to run the following command:

    ./ezbench -p mesa mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks


==== Adding benchmarks runs ====

Adding the 2 rounds of benchmark GLB27:Egypt:offscreen to the report
mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks for the commit HEAD can be done using the following
command:

    ./ezbench -r 2 -b GLB27:Egypt:offscreen -c HEAD mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks

A retrospective can be made in the same fashion as with core.sh at the exception
made that it would also work across reboots which is good when testing kernels:

    ./ezbench -r 3 -b GLB27:Egypt:offscreen -b GLB27:Trex:offscreen \
              -b GLB30:Manhattan:offscreen -b GLB30:Trex:offscreen \
              -b unigine:heaven:1080p:fullscreen -b unigine:valley:1080p:fullscreen \
              -c "`utils/get_commit_list.py -p ~/repos/mesa -s 2014-12-01 -i "1 week"`"
              mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks


==== Checking the status of a report ====

You can check the status of the 'mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks' report by calling
the following command:

    ./ezbench mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks status


==== Changing the execution status of the report ====

When creating a report, the default state of the report is "initial" which means
that nothing will happen until the state is changed. To change the state, you
need to run the following command:

    ./ezbench mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks (run|pause|abort)

 - The "run" state says that the report is ready to be run by ezbenchd.py.

 - The "pause" and "abort" states indicate that ezbenchd.py should not be
 executing any benchmarks from this report. The difference between the "pause"
 and "abort" states is mostly for humans, to convey the actual intent.


==== Starting collecting data without ezbenchd.py ====

If you are not using ezbenchd.py, you may simply run the following command to
start collecting data:

    ./ezbench mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks start

This command will automatically change the state of the report to "run".


== utils/owatch/owatch ==

This tool monitors the output (on stdout and stderr) of a program and
kills it if no output is seen in a given timeout period. If run as
root, owatch will open and activate a hardware watchdog, and will ping
it using the same timeout period. This will cause a reboot if no
output is seen.

This tool is only used by the tests that explicitly invoke it, it
won't be used automatically for anything. An example is
tests.d/piglit/igt.test.


=== Dependencies ===

 - gcc
 - make


== ezbenchd.py ==

This tool monitors the ezbench reports created using the "ezbench" command and
runs them if their state is right (state == RUN). It also schedules improvements
when the run is over before moving on to the next report. It thus allow for
collaborative sharing of the machine by different reports, as long as they
make sure not to change the global state.


=== Dependencies ===

 - ezbench.py

Python3 modules:
 - mako


=== Examples ===

Simply running ezbenchd.py is enough to run all reports which are
currently in the state "RUN", and set up an HTTP server to allow
interacting with ezbenchd and see results.

    ./ezbench -p mesa mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks
    ./ezbench -r 2 -b GLB27:Egypt:offscreen -c HEAD mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks
    ./ezbench mesa-tracking-pub-benchmarks run
    ./ezbenchd.py  --http_server=0.0.0.0:8080


=== Systemd integration ===

Here is an example of systemd unit you can use to run ezbenchd as a daemon. This is
needed if you want to test the kernel as you need to reboot. It will also add
an http server listening on all interfaces on the port 8080.

/etc/systemd/system/ezbenchd.service:
	[Unit]
	Description=Ezbench's daemon that executes the runs
	Conflicts=getty@tty5.service
	After=systemd-user-sessions.service getty@tty1.service plymouth-quit.service

	[Service]
	ExecStart=/.../ezbench/ezbenchd.py --http_server=0.0.0.0:8080
	User=$USER
	Group=$USER

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target


=== Nightly tests ===

There is currently no real support for nightly tests on ezbench. However, it is
quite trivial to use systemd to schedule updates to the repos and schedule runs
using ezbench's CLI interface.

/etc/systemd/system/ezbenchd_repo_update.timer:
	[Unit]
	Description=Run this timer every day to update repos and schedule runs
	[Timer]
	OnCalendar=*-*-* 20:30:00
	Persistent=true

	[Install]
	WantedBy=timers.target

/etc/systemd/system/ezbenchd_repo_update.service:
	[Unit]
	Description=Task to update the source repos and schedule more runs

	[Service]
	Type=oneshot
	WorkingDirectory=/.../ezbench
	ExecStart=/bin/bash repo_update.sh
	User=$USER
	Group=$USER

/.../ezbench/repo_update.sh:
	#!/bin/bash

	ezbench_dir=$(pwd)
	source user_parameters.sh

	set -x

	if [ -n "$REPO_MESA" ]
	then
			cd "$REPO_MESA"
			git fetch
			git reset --hard origin/master

			cd $ezbench_dir
			./ezbench -t gl_render -c HEAD -p mesa mesa_nightly run
	fi


=== Hooks ===

Just like for core.sh, you may also want to hook into the logic of ezbenchd. To
do so, you will need to write a program/script and give its path to ezbenchd
with the --hook option.

The program will receive the following variables in its environment:

    - action: Action that triggered the hook
        - start_running_tests: Smartezbench is about to run some tests
        - mode_changed: The mode of the report has changed
        - done_running_tests: Smartezbench is done running tests
    - ezbench_dir: Directory containing ezbench
    - ezbench_report_name: Name of the report currently being used
    - ezbench_report_path: Path to the folder containing the current report
    - ezbench_report_mode: Current mode of the report
    - ezbench_report_mode_prev: Previous value of the mode, only set if
                                action == mode_changed.

As an example, you could have the following hook script to print a message
whenever a mode change happens:

	import os
	if os.environ['action'] == "mode_changed":
		s = "{}: Mode changed from {} to {}"
		print(s.format(os.environ['ezbench_report_name'],
		               os.environ['ezbench_report_mode_prev'],
		               os.environ['ezbench_report_mode']))

== Multi-node support ==

Ezbench can be operated on multiple machines at the same time. In this case,
each machine will still bisect independently of what others are doing, in order
to maxime throughput.

Clients queuing work will do so using a REST interface which is exported by
controllerd.py. Work can be queued in multiple jobs, which can have their own
priority, allowing you to prioritize some tasks above others.

The different DUTs connect to controllerd.py by using dutd.py, which replaces
ezbenchd.py. Dutd.py receives the commands from the controller and update it as
for its current status.

Reports coming out of ezbench will be sent from the DUT to the controller using
git. The git URL is then shared with the original client, who can then clone and
pull from it as updates come.

Here are more details about the different components.

=== Controllerd.py ===

==== Dependencies ====

Mandatory:
 - python3
 - bottle : REST server
 - pygit2 : Git integration (based on libgit2)

==== Configuration ====

Controllerd is configured using a configuration file. Its default location is
/etc/ezbench/controllerd.ini, which can be overriden with the command line
argument --conf.

Here is a sample of the configuration file:

    [General]
    # Name: Name you want to give to this controller
    Name = MyController

    # StateFile: File containing the permanent state on controllerd.
    StateFile = /var/lib/controllerd/controllerd.state

    # StateFileLock: Lock file protecting the state file.
    StateFileLock = /var/lib/controllerd/controllerd.lock


    [RESTServer]
    # BindAddress: Address to bind for the public-facing REST server
    BindAddress = 0.0.0.0:8080


    [DUTServer]
    # BindAddress: Address to bind for the DUT-facing TCP server
    BindAddress = 0.0.0.0:42000


    [Reports]
    # ReportsBaseURL: Base URL for the read-only public-facing git repos that
    #                  contain the reports from the different jobs and machines.
    ReportsBaseURL = git://anongit.company.com/ezbench_reports

    # ReportsBasePath: Base path to where reports should be stored
    ReportsBasePath = /opt/ezbench/dut-reports


    [Repos]
    # GitRepoPath: Full path to the repo that will contain the different
    #              git histories used by the DUTs for testing
    GitRepoPath = /opt/sources/dut-repo


==== REST Interface ====

TODO: Check out unit_tests/controllerd.py.

=== Dutd.py ===

==== Dependencies ====

Same dependencies as ezbench.py.

==== Configuration ====

Dutd is configured using a configuration file. Its default location is
/etc/ezbench/dutd.ini, which can be overriden with the command line
argument --conf.

Here is a sample of the configuration file:

    [General]
    # Name: Name of this machine. By default, the hostname of the machine
    #       will be used.
    # Name =


    [Controller]
    # Address: Address of the controller. Format: host:port.
    Host = controller:42000

    # ReportsBaseURL: Base git URL that will be used to push the reports to
    #                the controller.
    ReportsBaseURL = dut@controller:/opt/ezbench/dut-reports

    # GitRepoURL: The URL to the controller's repo that holds all the versions
    #             that need to be tested locally.
    GitRepoURL = dut@controller:/opt/sources/dut-repo

    # Use one of the following methods
    [ControllerCredentials]
    # User: User to use for the authentication. If no password not key is
    #       specified, the SSH agent will be queried
    User = dut

    # SSHKeyPriv: Use the following ssh key
    #SSHKeyPriv = /home/ezbench/.ssh/id_rsa

    # SSHKeyPub: Use the following ssh key
    #SSHKeyPub = /home/ezbench/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    # SSHKeyPassphrase: Use the following passphrase to decrypt the key
    #SSHKeyPassphrase = mypassphrase

    # Password: Use the following tuple for authentication
    #Password = password
